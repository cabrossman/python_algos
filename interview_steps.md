### Framework
1. Write out problem they state
    - Questions: sorteed? dups? length? requirents on space or time complex? 
    - Balanced Tree? Binary Tree or Binary Search Tree
    - Edge cases: no match, empty array
2. Write Assert tests
    - Get inputs and outputs
3. Psuedocode / Brainstorm
    - high level solutions ideas
    - - brute force
    - - other ideas
    - big O notation - space and time
    - - time is more val than space. 
    - if stuck poke interviewer for help
    - with best solution write out detailed psuedo code / logic
4. Code it
    - optimize & remove 
5. Debug it - against the asserts
    - double check indicies
    - recusion - base case etc
6. Explain how it works to interviewer


### Notes
what is the best possible runtime? --> everything else in that rutime is a freebee
IF STUCK- come up with example
--> try to solve the most basic brute force
--> then try to optimize -- any short cuts
