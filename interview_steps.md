### Framework
1. Write out problem they state
    - list for clues! 
    - sorteed? dups? length? requirents on space or time complex? 
    - Balanced Tree? Binary Tree or Binary Search Tree
    - what if no match?
2. Write Assert tests
    - Get inputs and outputs
    - Assumptions - try to break it
    - Edge cases - try to break it more
    - Common : Duplicates, sorted, empty array, domain of problem
3. Psuedocode / Brainstorm
    - high level solutions ideas - consider brute force
    - big O notation - space and time
    - - time is more val than space. 
    - if stuck poke interviewer for help
    - with best solution write out detailed psuedo code / logic
4. Code it
    - optimize & remove 
5. Debug it - against the asserts
    - double check indicies
    - recusion - base case etc
6. Explain how it works to interviewer


### Notes
what is the best possible runtime? --> everything else in that rutime is a freebee
IF STUCK- come up with example
--> try to solve the most basic brute force
--> then try to optimize -- any short cuts
