"""
Given a string, sort it based on the decreasing frequency of its characters.

Input: "Programming"
Output: "rrggmmPiano"
Explanation: 'r', 'g', and 'm' appeared twice, so they need to appear before any other character.

Input: "abcbab"
Output: "bbbaac"
Explanation: 'b' appeared three times, 'a' appeared twice, and 'c' appeared only once.

O(K * log K + (Nâˆ’K) * log K) = O(N log K)
