Given an unsorted array of numbers, find the top K frequently occurring numbers in it.

Input: [1, 3, 5, 12, 11, 12, 11], K = 2
Output: [12, 11]
Explanation: Both '11' and '12' apeared twice.

Input: [5, 12, 11, 3, 11], K = 2
Output: [11, 5] or [11, 12] or [11, 3]
Explanation: Only '11' appeared twice, all other numbers appeared once.

O(K * log K + (Nâˆ’K) * log K) = O(N log K)
